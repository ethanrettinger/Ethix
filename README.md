# Ethix
Psuedoshell I wrote in javascript to interact with a filesystem. Has an embedded package manager and repository

## TODO LIST
~~1) When fetching for a package in the local /packages folder, read the package json and set the srcs to those scripts as well~~

2) Create an API for hotkeys and an event listener
3) 
4) Host an online repository with packages that users can download from the command line at any time

~~5) Log the previous commands and write them into the console when the page loads~~

6) Add user accounts and authentication stored in a hashed file locally

7) Add more default commands to the script.js file

~~8) Make the code more organized (like separating default commands into its own file)~~
