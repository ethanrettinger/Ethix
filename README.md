# Ethix
Psuedoshell I wrote in javascript.

The purpose of the ETHIX project was to accomplish 3 tasks:

1. Create a fast NodeJS package management system (Allows you to down/up-load projects to a database once I create it. Projects will be based on NodeJS
2. Create a system to containerize different applications with their own root file system and disable access outside of it
3. Expand my knowledge of JavaScript and the NodeJS Runtime

Unfortunately, I have lost most of my motivation to work on ETHIX. Once school lets back in, I may consider working on it again. But as of now, this project is not actively maintained nor is it being worked on whatsoever.
